# pinecall

Build voice agents as Ruby classes. Declared fields are the agent's state, `tool` methods are
what the model can call, the comment above each tool is its description, and an ERB view renders
the part of the prompt that changes during the call.

```ruby
require "pinecall"

# You are the front desk of Clínica Norte. Formal, short sentences.
class ClinicaNorte < Pinecall::Agent
  stage :identify, :book
  state :patient, visibility: :pii
  state :slots, []

  # Finds the patient by name and phone. Ask for both before calling it.
  tool stage: :identify, pii: %i[name phone]
  def find_patient(name:, phone:)
    self.patient = Agenda.find(name, phone)
    self.stage = :book if patient
    patient
  end

  # Free slots on one day.
  tool stage: :book, preview: 2
  def free_slots(day:)
    self.slots = Agenda.free(day)
  end
end
```

`views/clinica-norte.erb` renders the prompt from that state:

```erb
<% if stage == :identify -%>
Greet the caller and ask for their name and phone. Nothing else until the patient is identified.
<% end -%>

<% if remembers?("usual doctor") -%>
Offer their usual doctor's slots first.
<% end -%>

<% if slots.any? -%>
## Free slots, in order

<% slots.each do |slot| -%>
<%= slot.when %> with <%= slot.doctor %>
<% end -%>
<% end -%>
```

The prompt has four named blocks: `identity`, `knowledge` and `tools` are static and cached
before the history; `view` comes after it and is replaced every turn. A block is re-sent only when
its text changes.

Memory and knowledge-base results never enter the prompt. The platform runs `recall` and `search`
and returns their results to the model as tool results, so retrieved text is treated as data, not
instructions. A view can ask `remembers?("usual doctor")` and write its own sentence about the
answer.

## Five minutes

This gem is a library: the verbs are the one `pinecall` CLI's, the same for every language. In a
project laid out as `agents/<name>/agent.rb`, with this gem in its `Gemfile`:

```bash
bundle add pinecall
npm i -g pinecall                     # the CLI: Node, whatever the agent is written in
pinecall link                         # this folder tied to your org: its key, in ./.env
pinecall prompt --state test/<name>/goldens/a.json   # the exact prompt a state produces. No gateway.
pinecall chat                         # the agent served from this terminal, and a caller against it
pinecall test                         # ring 1: the goldens, scored by the gateway
pinecall start                        # registered and answering: the process you deploy
```

The CLI never loads your class: for `prompt`, `chat`, `test` and `start` it runs this gem's serve
entry, `bundle exec ruby -r pinecall -e 'exit Pinecall::Serve.main(ARGV)'`, and talks to it through
the gateway. The console, the knowledge bases, memory, keys and every other verb are the CLI's.
How a server runs the agent, with the CLI or inside your own Ruby process, is
[docs/production.md](docs/production.md).

## Architecture

This gem is the application side. It never talks to a model vendor or handles audio: it sends
commands and reads log entries over one WebSocket, in the runtime's own wire (`lib/pinecall/wire/`),
held to the runtime's golden call log. Tools are the only code that may change state.

| you want | you use |
|---|---|
| the class and the view | `Pinecall::Agent`, `Pinecall.mount` |
| the agent held inside your own process | `Pinecall.serve` |
| the socket alone, your own way of deciding what to answer | `Pinecall::Client` |
| a suite with no network, no key and no model | `pinecall/testing` |

```ruby
pc = Pinecall::Client.new(url: "https://cloud.pinecall.io", api_key: ENV.fetch("PINECALL_KEY"))
agent = pc.agent("clinica-norte", tools: [])
agent.on("turn.user") { |data, call| call.say("I heard: #{data[:text]}") }
pc.connect
```

## Testing it

Agent tests run with no network, key, model or gateway:

```ruby
require "pinecall/testing"

gateway = Pinecall::Testing::Gateway.new
Pinecall.mount(ClinicaNorte, client: gateway)

call = gateway.call_started(from: "+34600123456")
call.tool("free_slots", day: "Tuesday")

assert_includes call.prompt, "Tuesday at ten"
assert_equal %w[propose], call.tools
```

## Requirements

Ruby 3.2+. The only runtime dependency is `websocket-driver` (the driver ActionCable uses). The
`pinecall` CLI is a Node program (Node 24+): the verbs need it, the library does not.
