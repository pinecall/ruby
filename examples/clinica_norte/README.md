# Clínica Norte

A whole agent, written the way a customer writes one, on the one CLI's layout: the same agent as
the TypeScript example (`agents/examples/clinica-norte`), with the same agenda, the same documents
and the same eleven goldens, in Ruby.

The clinic is Spanish and so is everything its callers hear: the class's comments, the view and
the goldens are in Spanish on purpose. The framework's own rules are English, and tell the model to
answer in the caller's language.

```
agents/clinica-norte/agent.rb                  the class: state, stages, tools
agents/clinica-norte/agenda.rb                 the clinic's agenda, made up and fixed: what its API would be in production
agents/clinica-norte/views/clinica-norte.erb   the view: the `view` block, as a function of the state
docs/clinica-norte/*.md                        what it answers from, per turn: `pinecall docs push` uploads them
test/clinica-norte/clinica_test.rb             ring 0: no network, no key, no model, no gateway
test/clinica-norte/goldens/                    ring 1: eleven conversations, plus docs.json and memory.json
test/clinica-norte/memory/                     the extraction cases `pinecall remember` runs
```

The folder is named after the agent's slug: `agents/clinica-norte/` is the agent `clinica-norte`.

```bash
# the customer's own suite, run the way they run it
ruby -Ilib examples/clinica_norte/test/clinica-norte/clinica_test.rb

# the rest, with the one CLI (npm i -g pinecall), from this folder
pinecall prompt --state test/clinica-norte/goldens/no-reserva-antes-del-si.json
pinecall chat
pinecall test                    # ring 1: rake ring1 from the gem's root
pinecall start
```

The CLI never loads the class: it starts this gem's `Pinecall::Serve` entry
([../../docs/production.md](../../docs/production.md)). In this checkout the gem is `lib/`:
`RUBYLIB=../../lib` in front of each verb, which is what `rake ring1` does.

What the front desk knows by heart — hours, prices, what needs an authorisation — is not in this
repository: it is written in the console, Settings ▸ Knowledge (or `pinecall agent knowledge
edit`), and the model reads it whole on every call. The voice, the model, the greeting, the
language, what memory keeps (`pinecall memory policy`) and the base it searches per turn
(`pinecall docs attach clinica-norte --k 4`) are the world's, not the class's, and a class that
still declares one is refused at load.

## What this example teaches

- **A stage moves the tools.** `stage :identify, :choose, :book, :done` is a state field like any
  other, and `stage:` on a tool is sugar over `when:`.
- **A slot is booked by its id, never by its time.** Two slots at the same hour with different
  professionals are indistinguishable in words; one id looks like no other, and one the agenda
  never offered is refused with the list of those it did.
- **`propose` and `book` are two moments.** Without the `proposed` field the view cannot tell
  whether to read the time back or to book it, and an obedient model reads it back again instead
  of booking.
- **The day is resolved to a date in code.** "Tuesday" said on a Thursday is one date and one
  only; a day with no agenda comes back empty, and the view names it.
- **`confirm:` is what makes `book` irreversible on the wire.** The platform reads the sentence
  after the booking, with what the tool returned.
- **`preview: 2` cuts what the model sees, not what the state keeps.**
- **The view is only what the clinic writes.** What memory recalled and what the base answered
  reach the model as a tool result, in the history. The view asks `remembers?("médico habitual")`
  and decides on a sentence of its own with the answer.
